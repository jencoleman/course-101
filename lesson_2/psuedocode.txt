1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

casual psuedocode

- welcome user
- ask user for an integer
- save integer to variable
- ask user for another integer
- save interger to another variable
- add the numbers together
- return the addition answer

formal psuedocode
START

- welcome user
- ask user for integer
GET integer from user
SET num1 = user input

-ask user for second integer
GET integer from user
SET num2 = user input

SET answer = num1 + num2

READ answer variable

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

string_array = [ 'g', 's', 'l']

casual

- set a variable equal to the answer, make it an empty string
- iterate through each string, concating to the answer variable
- return the answer variable

formal
START
SET answer = ''
SET input = user argument
READ every string in from the argument array
-concatenate every string to the answer string
READ answer string

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

casual
- set input array to a variable
- set answer to empty array
- iterate over every other of the input array, sending the values to the answer array
- return asnwer array

formal
START

SET answer = []
SET input = user argument

iterate over every other array index with each_index % 2 != 0
push the array values to answer
READ answer
